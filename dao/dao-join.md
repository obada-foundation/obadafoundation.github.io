# WHY SHOULD YOU JOIN THE DAO?

<div style="font-size:18px;"> Join the movement to revolutionize IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) and propel this industry into the future. OBADA is writing an ISO Standard (ISO/AWI 20435) that details the method for digitally tracking physical assets using non-fungible tokens. 
<br/><br/> 
As a DAO Member you will become an operator of the world's first utility that enables enterprise and supply chain systems to digitally represent physical assets and create a decentralized "Carfax™" system. This innovative approach allows companies to capture permanent, interoperable records of any asset, from manufacturer to recycler, and establishes a global standard for ordering and tracking end-of-life services, such as data destruction and recycling.

DAO members are like the “owners” of this non-company. They run the software, vote on all platform changes, and set all platform fees and rewards.
