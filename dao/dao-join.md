# WHY SHOULD YOU JOIN THE DAO?

### **Join us** in shaping the future of IT Asset Disposition (ITAD). Help us create a public utility to allow enterprise or supply chain systems to digitally represent physical assets as NFTs (pNFTs). We will be creating a decentralized “Carfax™” to capture permanent, interoperable recordkeeping of any asset, from manufacturer to recycler, and give the world a standard for ordering and tracking end-of-life services such as data destruction and recycling.

  <summary>What is a DAO? </summary>

  <div markdown="1">
    
    DAO stands for "Decentralized Autonomous Organization." Unlike a traditional trade organization, or an LLC, there is no central decision maker or single owner or entity in control. DAO members are like the “owners” of this non-company. They run the software, vote on all platform changes, and set all platform fees and rewards. 

  </div>

</details>


<details>
  <summary>What is ITAD?</summary>

  <div markdown="1">

<details>
  <summary>What are DAO Members expected to do?</summary>

  <div markdown="1">
    
    As a DAO member you would be responsible for voting on any future changes to the network. Also, you would be expected to either run a blockchain node, work with the DAO to ensure one is operating on your behalf, or to transfer your node rights to someone who will run a node for the system. Apart from that, being an active participant in helping to advocate for, or drive adoption efforts would be greatly appreciated.
