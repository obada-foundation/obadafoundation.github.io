# Join the OBADA DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

The OBADA DAO is a tokenized governance structure for member organizations actively engaged in developing and operating industry-standard protocols for IT asset disposition. The DAO enables member companies to collectively advance ITAD industry standards, improve operational efficiency, and strengthen market position through collaborative technology development.

OBADA's DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) is a **member organization consortium** focused on developing and implementing technology standards that serve the business interests of companies in the IT asset disposition (ITAD) and electronics recycling industry. This structure provides transparent, collective decision-making where member organizations use blockchain-based governance tokens to vote on technical standards, allocate development resources, and shape industry protocols that enhance their competitive positioning.

This governance model combines traditional industry expertise with modern decentralized technology, enabling member companies across the ITAD ecosystem - from recyclers and refurbishers to technology providers and enterprises - to collaborate on developing standards that improve their operational efficiency and market opportunities while maintaining individual competitive advantages.

To **participate in this industry consortium**, member organizations have **two membership pathways** that align with different engagement models:

### Option 1: Strategic Member Organization

This membership tier is designed for organizations ready to make a strategic commitment to advancing ITAD industry standards through financial investment and governance participation.

By investing in consortium tokens, member organizations gain access to the technical working groups, governance rights, and industry networking opportunities that drive standard development.

**Membership Investment Tiers:**
(Subject to consortium approval)
- **Tier 1:** Entry-level membership providing foundational access to technical resources and working groups
- **Tier 2:** Enhanced membership with expanded governance participation and technical committee access
- **Tier 3:** Strategic membership with full governance rights and leadership opportunities in strategic initiatives

**Strategic Member Benefits:**
- Full access to technical working groups and industry forums
- Direct participation in standard-setting processes
- Networking opportunities with industry peers and partners
- Governance rights proportional to membership tier
- Priority access to new technical implementations and protocols


### Option 2: Contributing Member Organization

This membership pathway enables organizations to participate through technical contributions and active engagement in standard development rather than financial investment.

Contributing members earn governance tokens through their technical work, documentation contributions, and participation in working groups. This model recognizes the value of expertise and active participation in building industry standards.

**Contributing Member Benefits:**
- Active participation in technical standard development
- Access to industry working groups and technical forums
- Networking opportunities within the consortium
- Earned governance rights based on contribution levels
- Recognition for technical expertise and industry leadership


## Membership Process:

1. **Submit Organizational Application**: Complete the consortium membership application detailing your organization's ITAD industry involvement and intended contributions
2. **Consortium Review**: Applications are reviewed by the membership committee composed of current member organizations
3. **Onboarding Process**: Approved organizations receive governance tokens and access to consortium platforms and working groups
4. **Active Participation**: Engage in technical committees, governance votes, and industry standard development

## Consortium Participation Requirements

Member organizations are expected to:
- Maintain active participation in relevant working groups
- Contribute industry expertise to standard development
- Uphold consortium bylaws and governance protocols
- Represent their organization's interests while advancing industry-wide standards
