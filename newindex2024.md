# Welcome to The OBADA Foundation

The OBADA Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit coalition dedicated to revolutionizing the IT asset disposition (ITAD) sector. Our mission is to build and maintain an open-source blockchain protocol that empowers recycling industries, manufacturers, and individuals to track and document information technology (IT) assets throughout their lifecycle.

## About Us

### Our Purpose

At The OBADA Foundation, we serve three primary functions:

1. **Stewardship**: We act as the steward for the OBADA Standard, an open protocol describing data models. We are actively collaborating with ISO to develop this industry-standard.

2. **Real-world Challenges**: We address real-world issues, such as legal matters, fiat currency, and the complexities of the asset disposition industry.

3. **Software Development**: We are dedicated to developing the initial software and establishing the OBADA DAO to run the decentralized software application.

### Our Vision

Our vision is to enable participants in the information technology supply chain to:

- Safeguard ownership of IT assets.
- Track IT assets from creation to end-of-life.
- Control data sharing about their assets.
- Facilitate recycling and the circular economy.
