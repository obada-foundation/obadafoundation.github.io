## Transforming IT Asset Management Through Open Standards

The OBADA Foundation is a 501(c)(6) nonprofit industry coalition bringing together leaders in IT asset disposition (ITAD), electronics recycling, and blockchain technology. We're building the future of responsible asset management through open-source innovation.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to advance member business interests by creating and promoting an open blockchain protocol that transforms how organizations track, manage, and responsibly dispose of IT assets throughout their lifecycle.

## What We Do

### Standards Development
We develop and maintain the Open Blockchain for Asset Disposition Architecture (OBADA) Protocol - an open-source standard for creating immutable records of IT assets from manufacture through end-of-life.

### Industry Collaboration
We bring together ITAD companies, recyclers, OEMs, enterprises, and technology providers to establish common standards that benefit the entire ecosystem.

### Technology Innovation
Our blockchain-based approach creates transparent, verifiable chains of custody that build trust, reduce fraud, and improve environmental outcomes in electronics recycling.

## Why It Matters

- **$62.5 billion** in e-waste generated globally each year
- **Only 20%** of electronics are properly recycled
- **Billions in value** lost due to lack of tracking and verification
- **Environmental impact** from improper disposal threatens communities worldwide

## Get Involved

Whether you're an ITAD provider, electronics recycler, enterprise IT manager, or technology innovator, OBADA offers opportunities to shape the future of our industry.
