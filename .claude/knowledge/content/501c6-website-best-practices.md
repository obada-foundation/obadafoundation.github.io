# 501(c)(6) Website Best Practices for IRS Approval

When designing and maintaining a website for a 501(c)(6) organization (such as a business league, chamber of commerce, or trade association), it’s important to ensure the website content and structure align with IRS guidelines. This helps demonstrate that the organization operates primarily to promote the common business interests of its members, rather than engaging in prohibited activities.

Below are best practices to follow for your 501(c)(6) organization’s website to support IRS approval and ongoing compliance.

## 1. Clearly State the Organization’s Purpose

- **Mission Statement:** Prominently display a concise mission statement that reflects the organization’s business league or trade association purpose.
- **Tax-Exempt Status:** Include a statement confirming the organization’s 501(c)(6) tax-exempt status and its focus on promoting the common business interests of its members.

## 2. Focus Website Content on Member Services and Industry Promotion

- **Educational Resources:** Provide industry news, research, training, and professional development materials.
- **Advocacy and Lobbying:** Transparently describe any lobbying or advocacy activities that relate directly to the business interests of members.
- **Networking Opportunities:** Highlight events, conferences, and forums designed to facilitate member networking and collaboration.
- **Member Benefits:** Clearly outline benefits available to members such as discounts, certifications, or business referrals.

## 3. Avoid Prohibited Activities or Private Benefit

- **No Commercial Sales:** Do not sell products or services unrelated to the organization’s exempt purpose.
