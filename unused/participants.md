## Participants

### Summary

There are two groups of OBADA participants; "Industry Stakeholders" who have an operational (day-to-day) role in the processing of used hardware, and "Ecosystem Stewards" who represent the broader interest of how the ecosystem affect the world's environment and economy.

### Definitions

+ "The Network" - The OBADA "blockchain"
+ "The Ecosystem" - The community of interacting organizations with a vested interest in the managing the processing and disposal of used electronics.
+ "The Industry" Organizations in the ecosystem directly involved with the equipment.
+ "Ecosystem Stewards" Organizations without a direct role in the industry that have a vested interest (either financial, environmental, or regulatory) in the health of the network.
+ "Role"  The function of a group or entity, from the perspective of the network.


## Industry Stakeholders
