  ## OBADA Overview
  
  </summary>

**1. What is the goal of OBADA?**
To build a blockchain solution to track physical assets through their lifetimes using pNFTs on a blockchain, to facilitate device and component reuse, and end-of-life proper recovery or disposal.

**2. What is a pNFT?**
Representing physical assets using Non-Fungible Tokens.

**3. How is this standard different?**
The OBADA standard makes it possible to:
1. Uniquely identify any physical asset with a serial number, using a short Universal Serial Number (USN)
2. Create a pNFT to represent that asset on a blockchain
3. Track changes to the asset or its ownership, throughout its lifetime, as a pNFT on the blockchain
  
No standard has ever done any of those before.
 
**4. What are the Organizations that are Involved in this project?**
There are two primary organizations:
- The OBADA Foundation - promoting the standard, and getting the blockchain built, initially
- The OBADA DAO - building and operating the decentralized registry for the ITAD industry

There is a third organization involved, with a much smaller role, OBADA Business Services (OBS). OBS is a contractor to perform network maintenance, facilitate the software development, and provide technical assistance for DAO members.

**5. What does OBADA stand for?**
Open Blockchain for Asset Disposition Architecture. Earlier, the second A stood for Association, but once upon a time, we changed it to Architecture. We could always change it back, if everyone wants to. But it seems like for branding purposes, we should keep the OBADA acronym.

**6. Who legally owns the Intellectual Property of the OBADA standard?**
No one. OBADA is an open standard, so anyone could write their own software that is compliant with it. 

Anyone could petition the OBADA Foundation to make a change to improve the standard.
  
**7. Who legally owns the software to run the decentralized registry?**
The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) and owns the code it has commissioned.
Software is licensed under the GNU XXX.
The source code is freely available on Github. 
However, companies must pay for a license and join the DAO in order to use it.
Anyone could download the code and modify it as they see fit, and run it.
The OBADA Foundation hopes to respond to any needs or requests in such a way that no organization ever feels the need to develop a competing standard.

**8. Why do we need a standard?**
For interoperability. We need to have one entity defining things like what to call the information to be shared, and define the structure of how that data is stored and shared. If you think of the data being shared like it was all on a spreadsheet, there has to be agreement on what to call the columns.

**9. Is OBADA an open standard?**
Yes, itâ€™s right there, in the first word of the name: Open Blockchain for Asset Disposition Architecture. This means anyone can download the software, similar to how Linux is an open standard. However, to use it, they must pay a license fee, and have to join DAO.
