### Robin Ingenthron | Good Point Recycling | United States

<img src="../obada-foundation/bod-images/robin-headshot.jpeg"  align="left" vspace="5" hspace="10" height="75px" width="75px">

"Trying to recreate my Peace Corps experience through my business, bringing wealth and value to friends overseas through fair trade environmental standards..." Ingenthron believes that the amount of money society will make available to improve the environment is finite, and believes regulation of the free market must be done wisely and sparingly. When recycling isn't working in the free market, there is usually a cause. The amount of material or scale of collection may be too limited, or there may be a subsidy on virgin material (General Mining Act of 1872).
