The OBADA Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit coalition in the IT asset disposition (ITAD) sector. We serve as stewards for the OBADA Standard and work in collaboration with ISO to develop open protocols for data models in the ITAD industry. Our foundation focuses on real-world solutions in legal, financial, and industry-specific contexts.

### Mission

Our mission is to develop and maintain an open-source blockchain protocol to enable tracking and documentation of IT assets across their lifecycle. This effort is led by our members, key players in the electronics recycling industry, to foster a sustainable and responsible digital economy.

### Vision

We aim to empower stakeholders in the information technology supply chain to:

- Safeguard ownership of IT assets.
- Track IT assets from creation to end-of-life.
- Control data sharing about their assets.
- Promote recycling and the circular economy.
