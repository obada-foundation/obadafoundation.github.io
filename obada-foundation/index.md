## The OBADA Foundation
The OBADA Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit coalition of stakeholders in the IT asset disposition (ITAD) sector.  It's traditional off-chain organization which primarily serves three functions:

1. The foundation acts as the steward for the **OBADA Standard**, an open protocol describing the data models.  **The OBADA Foundation** is working with **ISO** to develop this standard.   

2. The foundation deals with **"real-world" issues** such as lawyers, fiat, and the asset disposition industry.

3. The foundation is chartered with **developing the initial software** and **forming the OBADA DAO** to run the decentralized software application.
