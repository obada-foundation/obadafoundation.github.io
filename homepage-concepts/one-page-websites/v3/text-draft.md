# Welcome to OBADA

# OBADA defines the "PHYSICAL NFT"
A “physical NFT” consists of three parts:

```CSS:  Please make these into three side-by-side boxes with some icon at the top```

	The Physical Layer
	  • A standard method for self-generating decentralized identifiers for physical assets, based on the assets serial number.
	The NFT Registry
	  • A decentralized registry for storing data associated with the physical object.
	The NFT Oracle Service
	  • A bridge to connect layer-1 blockchains and supply chain system to the NFT data andto the physical object itself.

# OBADA provides a foundational infrastructure component 
```CSS:  Please make these into three side-by-side boxes with some icon at the top```
* for supply chain systems and layer one blockchain interoperability 
	via creating a standard method  for representing physical assets as NFTs.  OBADA NFTs can ride on any chain.

* for the digital transformation of the recycling sector
	by enabling proof of data sanitization, recycling, and decentralized chain of custody services.
	
* for organizations with EOL IT assets.
	The real-world can now register it’s assets as NFTs to enable proof of data sanitization, responsible recycling, and other asset disposition services.
	
# HOW OBADA IS GOVERNED
Governance of a physical NFT requires both a real-world and a virtual side.

```CSS:  Please put these into two boxes side-by-side```

## The OBADA Foundation 501(c)6
* About
	* a 501(c)6 nonprofit coalition in the asset disposition sector 
	* 11 BOD members industry appointed BOD members
* Responsibilities include:
	* industry relations and adoption
	* standard development
	* tokenization plan
	* emergencies
* contractor budget
	* initial development team
	* onboarding tech support
	* network maintenance
* Governance method:  Old school (offline via traditional BOD meetings per obada.io/bylaws)
* Gofund the foundation.   So we can afford a real website.

## The OBADA DAO
* About
	* A Wyoming DAO LLC
	* Membership goal: 100 members (currently 7)
		* for organizations in the asset disposition 
		* Requires $5000 stake in OBD.
		* accredited/corporate investors only
* Voting Responsibilities  
	* improvements and changes (via offline vote for now)
	* everything that can be decentralized and automated.
	* 	fees, rewards, etc.


# OBADA is built on OPEN STANDARDs
* Every aspect of OBADA is deterministic and/or self-sovereign, based on open technologies
* OBADA is working with ISO to standardize our approach. (or whatever we are allowed to say here)


# HOW the ECONOMY WORKS
An ERC-20 utility token known as OBD acts as the network medium of exchange, providing access to the system and the utility of ordering asset disposition services.

* Fees and rewards are created and distributed to the users, actors, and stakers of the system in a circular decentralized fashion.  

```CSS: please put these two boxes side-by-side```

# PLATFORM Fees

## Industry (Registry) Fees
* (.00000001-.001) OBD "Gas Fee": A registry "write" fee charged to platform actors to provide min-viable funding for the platform
* 1%-10% Asset Disposition Service Fee:   Platform charge for asset disposition proofs processed via the platform.

## End-User (L1) Fees
* Asset Disposition Fee:  a “platform fee” at the layer-1 level for end-users.  
	* Consider this a decentralized “recycling fee” so the burden of the system cost is on the end-user. 

# Rewards
* A network reward of (1 OBD) for completion of a platform KPI (key performance indicators)
* 	Proof of Data Sanitization, Proof of Reuse, and Proof of Recycling.

# FEE and REWARD DISTRIBUTION
* Fees are distributed to OBD Stakers in proportion to their stake
* Rewards are distributed as follows
	* 1/3 to actor chain leading to the proof
	* 1/3 for staked OBD
	* 1/3 to the OBADA treasury

# FEE and REWARD AMOUNTS
* All fees and rewards amounts are voted on by the DAO membership.

# STAKING
"Staking" OBD means locking it up so it cannot be used.   
* DAO Members must "stake nodes" with a minimum of $5000 USD of OBD to receive node and governance rights
* User can "stake" each NFT with $1USD of OBD as a way to "stake recycling"
* Stakers receive the system fees and rewards as "yeild" on their "investment" in the system.

# OBD TOKEN ISSUANCE and PURCHASING

Pre-Launch: 50 million OBD will be distributed pre-launch as follows:
* 16% founding team
* 16% Initial DAO Members (7)
* 16% Phase 2 DAO Members (~15)
* 16% Phase 3 DAO Members (~75)
* 33% reserve for industry/institutional investors

These tokens will be locked (staked) for a period of _3 years__ (per DAO vote)

Min-Viable Production: An additional 50 million tokens will be created
* Resold via the DAO members from a community pool
	* 10% commission to the seller (per DAO vote)
	* 15% to fund OBADA and DAO efforts
	* 75% to a treasury reserve for token buyback (liquidity reserve) and other purposes.

At this time there are no plans to offer OBD to the general public or on any public token exchange.   At this time, OBADA is a permissioned industry-led project targetted at the asset disposition sector.
