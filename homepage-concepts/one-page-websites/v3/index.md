# NFTs for Physical Objects

OBADA provides a standard method for creating NFTs for physical objects, and a decentralized NFT registry in which to store them. A physical NFT differs from a digital NFT because there needs to be a connection to the real-world object.

The real-world side is governed by a traditional foundation. The "blockchain" is run by a DAO.

# OBADA is built on OPEN STANDARDs
* Every aspect of OBADA is deterministic and/or self-sovereign, based on open technologies
* OBADA is working with ISO to standardize our approach. (or whatever we are allowed to say here)

# The DECENTRALIZED ECONOMY:  FEES and REWARDS
* The network medium of exchange, an ERC-20 utility token called OBD.
* OBD can be staked to fund the system.
* Platform fees and rewards in OBD are distributed to the OBD stakers.


## PLATFORM FEES

<div class="blocks-2 mt-4">
	<div class="block">
		<h3 class="mb-3">Industry (Registry) Fees</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Minimum viable fees for the industry to self-fund the system.</li>
			<li><strong>.001 OBD "Gas Fee":</strong> A "write" fee to fund nodes.</li>
			<li><strong>1% Service Fee:</strong> A markup on asset disposition services to fund the system.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<h3 class="mb-3">End-User (L1) Fees</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Platform revenue collected from the outside world, distributed to the on-chain asset disposition ecosystem.</li>
			<li><strong>1 OBD “Platform/Oracle fee”:</strong> a one-time "per NFT" fee collected at the oracle gateway from L1-blockchains and outside supply-chain systems.</li>
			<li><strong>Decentralized “recycling fee”</strong> so the burden of the system cost is on the end-user.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

## Recycling Mining Rewards
* A reward is mined for successfully recycling a device, or extending it's life through reuse.
* 1 OBD is mined upon completion of a platform KPI (key performance indicators): Proof of Data Sanitization and Reuse, or Proof of Recycling.

## Fee and Reward Distribution
* **Fees** are distributed to OBD Stakers in proportion to their stake
* **Urban Recyling Rewards** are distributed as follows
	* 1/3 to actor chain leading to the proof
	* 1/3 for staked OBD
	* 1/3 to the OBADA treasury


## Deciding on Fee and Reward Amounts
* All fees and rewards amounts are voted on by the DAO membership.


---


# STAKING
"Staking" OBD means locking it up so it cannot be used.   As compensation, stakers receive a proportionate share of fee and rewards revenue.

* DAO Members must "stake nodes" to receive node and governance rights
* User can optionally "stake" their NFT for the **urban recycling reward**.

# OBD TOKEN ISSUANCE and PURCHASING

Pre-Launch: 50 million OBD will be distributed pre-launch as follows:
* 16% founding team
* 16% Initial DAO Members (7) 
* 16% Phase 2 DAO Members (~15)  [join phase 2]()
* 16% Phase 3 DAO Members (~75)
* 33% reserve for industry/institutional investors

These tokens will be locked (staked) for a period of _3 years__ (per DAO vote)

Min-Viable Production: An additional 50 million tokens will be created
* Resold via the DAO members from a community pool
	* 10% commission to the seller (per DAO vote)
	* 15% to fund OBADA and DAO efforts
	* 75% to a treasury reserve for token buyback (liquidity reserve) and other purposes.

# LEGAL
* At this time there are no plans to offer OBD to the general public or on any public token exchange.   
* At this time, OBADA is a permissioned industry-led project targetted at the asset disposition sector.
* At this time, only accredited or corporate investors may purchase OBD or DAO stakes.
