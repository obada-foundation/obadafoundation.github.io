## Token Economics

This section will discuss the inflationary and deflationary forces driving the price of the OBD-20 token.


### Staking the DAO
	* The first 50 million tokens will be locked for three years so do not factor until year three.

### Initial Supply (years 1-3):  50 million
* An initial sale of 50 million OBD will be made available at the launch.
* These will be sold to the ITAD community by the DAO members using a shared (centralized) credit-card system supplied by the OBADA Foundation.
	* Per agreement these will be sold at $1 each. by all parties. 
	* The buyer pays an additional credit card fee plus a 5% surcharge to fund the OBADA Foundation
	* The DAO seller will keep 10% commission
	* The balance ($0.90) will go to the OBADA Treasury

### Deflationary force: Staking OBITS 
* If the mechanism of “staking OBITS” is successful then a significant portion of OBD could be locked up for a significant portion of the products EOL cycle. .. months r perhaps years.
*  This would mean a naturally **slow monetary velocity** as the currency does not frequently change hands.  
* Since the currency is less available, the price would rice.

### Deflationary force: recycling loss
* Although the blockchain platform is meant for tracking, in the wild many devices will likely just go “off-chain” over time, resulting in a loss of OBD.
* Each year only 15% of the worlds electronics are known to be recycled, and a high percentage of these are “lost in the system”.    So only a few percent “make it through”.
* It’s unknown what the loss rate will be however it can be assumed to be non-zero.
* Any loss in OBD would be a permanent decrease in supply, so OBD prices would rise.

### Inflationary force:  Mining OBD Rewards.
* A 1 OBD  “recycling rewards” is mined for every successful ecosystem KPI.   So effectively, every time a device is recycled or has its life extended via re-use, then new OBD token is created.
* If a high proportion of devices are recycled then a significant amount of OBD would be mined.   If the amount mined is larger than the deflationary forces above. the currency would devalue.
* DAO Governance needs to carefully set the mining reward rate based on a careful economic analysis.  


### Use of Treasury
* Provided that the OBADA Foundation is funded “off the top” of OBD sales, the treasury can be completely allocated as per the DAO governance.   Probably uses:
	* For OBD buyback (to create liquidity)
	* To fund development, initiatives, charitable causes, and grants.
