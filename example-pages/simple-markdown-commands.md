You must write in MARKDOWN.   It works like this:

# This is a header (H1)
## This is an H2
### This is an H3

These are bullets
* bullet 1
* bullet 2
* bullet 3
* bullet 4

**This is bold text.**
_These are italics._

You can make tables and other stuff too.

Everything written in markdown is automatically converted to HTML.

EASY!
