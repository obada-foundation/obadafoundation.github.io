#  The OBD Utility Token 
*  While the OBIT NFT Registry is a purpose built decentralized tool, the financial layer of OBADA uses a standard ERC-20 token called the OBD.  OBD tokens are a legally compliant **utility token** per the State of Wyoming.
*  OBD is available for purchase through the OBADA Foundation or through DAO members.  OBD will not be made available on any public exchange.   

## OBD as the Medium of Exchange
 * As the ecosystem medium of exchange., OBD is used to pay platform fees.   But while OBD functions as a currency within the ecosystem, its main use is to provide utility.

## OBD Utility
  * As a utility, OBD is used to order and pay for platform-defined asset disposition key performance indicators (KPIs) such as proof of data destruction,  functionality, reuse, and recycling.

* The network medium of exchange, an ERC-20 utility token called OBD.
* OBD can be staked to fund the system.
* Platform fees and rewards in OBD are distributed to the OBD stakers.


## PLATFORM FEES

<div class="blocks-2 mt-4">
	<div class="block">
		<h3 class="mb-3">Industry (Registry) Fees</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Minimum viable fees for the industry to self-fund the system.</li>
			<li><strong>.001 OBD "Gas Fee":</strong> A "write" fee to fund nodes.</li>
			<li><strong>1% Service Fee:</strong> A markup on asset disposition services to fund the system.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="block">
		<h3 class="mb-3">End-User (L1) Fees</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Platform revenue collected from the outside world, distributed to the on-chain asset disposition ecosystem.</li>
			<li><strong>1 OBD “Platform/Oracle fee”:</strong> a one-time "per NFT" fee collected at the oracle gateway from L1-blockchains and outside supply-chain systems.</li>
			<li><strong>Decentralized “recycling fee”</strong> so the burden of the system cost is on the end-user.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

## Recycling Mining Rewards
* A reward is mined for successfully recycling a device, or extending it's life through reuse.
* 1 OBD is mined upon completion of a platform KPI (key performance indicators): Proof of Data Sanitization and Reuse, or Proof of Recycling.

## Fee and Reward Distribution
* **Fees** are distributed to OBD Stakers in proportion to their stake
* **Urban Recyling Rewards** are distributed as follows
	* 1/3 to actor chain leading to the proof
	* 1/3 for staked OBD
	* 1/3 to the OBADA treasury


## Deciding on Fee and Reward Amounts
* All fees and rewards amounts are voted on by the DAO membership.

## OBD Staking 
 *  As a decentralized finance mechanism, OBD can be **staked**  in order to secure voting rights and a proportional share of platform revenue and rewards.
 * Staked OBD tokens are “locked up” and cannot be used, which shows a financial commitment to the system and is a deflationary force limiting available supply.
	 *  There are two methods for staking OBD
		  * **Stake a Node** - for DAO members
		  * **Stake OBITs** - for anyone

### Staking OBD for Governance Rights
* As a governance mechanism,  OBD is used by DAO members who must commit to host a node staked with a minimum of 5,000,000 OBD in order to receive one vote.

### Staking for Platform Income
 * As a vertical-market decentralized finance application, OBD effectively makes stakers the “owners” of the platform who collectively share in the profits.
	* The sum of the platform fees equals the platform revenue.  
	* Platform revenue is distributed proportionally on a nightly basis based on OBD stake.
	* This nightly fee distribution to stakers is effectively a share of the system profits.   	

### Staking for Yield
*  As an incentive mechanism, OBD can be “mined by recycling”.  
 * When an asset disposition KPI is completed on a staked OBIT, the staked OBD is automatically returned to the original staker and a new OBD is created and distributed as follows:
	 * 1/4 to the OBIT staker
	 * 1/4 to the actor chain
	 * 1/4 to the recycler (or end processor)
	 * 1/4 to the DAO members and OBIT stakers
 * These platform rewards which are received by the stakers are effectively a dividend, returning an additional yield on the staked equity beyond the share of platform revenue.

# OBD Token Issuance - Platform Currency
An ERC-20 token known as the “OBD” is the network medium of exchange.  

## OBD TOKEN ISSUANCE and PURCHASING

Pre-Launch: 50 million OBD will be distributed pre-launch as follows:
* 16% Founding Team
* 16% Initial DAO Members (7) 
* 16% Phase 2 DAO Members (~15) 
* 16% Phase 3 DAO Members (~75)
* 33% reserve for industry/institutional investors

These tokens will be locked (staked) for a period of _3 years__ (per DAO vote)

# FUNDING INITIAL DEVELOPMENT - Summary
Funds received from the sale of intial DAO memberships will be used to finance development of the system.   
* The plan is for 100 DAO Members to stake $5000 each in three phases:
	* Phase 1:  Initial 7 DAO members:  $35,000  total for pilot development 
	* Phase 2: 13-18  “pre-launch”:  $65K-$90K for minimum viable production development
	* Phase 3:  75  “MV-launch”: $375,000 for improving and scaling the min-viable production system. 
	* Additional phases can be added per DAO proposal and vote.		 

The initial funds will be administered by the foundation, with the bulk going to the contract firm overseeing development.


# FUNDING FOUNDATION OPERATIONS & TREASURY
At the min-viable production launch an additional 50 million tokens will be created
* These will be sold via the DAO members from a community pool, centrally managed by the OBADA Foundation.
* Once the 50 million are sold, no additional tokens will be created.
* The funds received from OBD token sales will be distributed as follows:
	* A 5% surcharge on sales (off the top) to pay credit card fees and to fund the OBADA Foundation
	* A 10% commission to the seller (DAO member selling the tokens).
	* 90% to a DAO treasury reserve	for token buyback (liquidity reserve) and other purposes.

# OBD LEGAL Compliance
* At this time there are no plans to offer OBD to the general public or on any public token exchange.   
* At this time, OBADA is a permissioned industry-led project targeted at the asset disposition sector.
* At this time, only accredited or corporate investors may purchase OBD or DAO stakes.
