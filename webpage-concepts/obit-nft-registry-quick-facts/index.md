# OBIT NFT Registry QUICK FACTS
A decentralized NFT Registry for physical devices.   

OBADA, the "Open Blockchain for Asset Disposition Architecture" is an open protocol to provide a standard method for creating NFTs for physical objects, and a decentralized NFT data registry in which to store them.


### Quick Facts:
* **The OBADA Standard** defines an open algorithmic method to create an NFT for any physical object based on serial numbers and other human-readable information.  These NFTs are called OBITs.
* **The OBIT Registry** stores NFT data and is the result of a three year effort by a coalition from the IT asset disposition (ITAD) industry to create a sort of "ecosystem as a service" to enable on-chain tracking end-of-life asset disposition services such as proof of data destruction, reuse, and recycling.
* **OBADA is working with ISO** to standardize the data model for physical NFTs to create an interoperable layer-1 independant NFT data repository as a **foundational infrastructure component** for the provable sharing of physical asset data between asset disposition systems and layer-1 blockchains.

## What is a Physical NFT?
A Physical NFT is like a decentralized "Carfax" which lives at univeral address and holds any and all data about a device; service records, ownership history, a record of ownership (anonymized), and even an IOT endpoint for accessing the device.

An OBIT NFT can also hold money in the form of OBD.  OBD is attached to OBITs pays not only for platform fees but also for platform-defined asset disposition serviceslike drive wiping, refurbishment for reuse, and recycling.


## Physical NFTs are more complex than digital NFTs.
A physical NFT needs to have a connection to the real-world object.   Only a transitory connection can be made to upload machine-read or human-read) data, but a permanent connectoin is needed for enabling an IOT endpoint.
